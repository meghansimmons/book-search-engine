## Usage
The **book-search-engine** application allows a user to search for books with the Google Books API by typing in keywords into the search bar. If a user would like to save books, they need to first sign up and then log in. Once a user is logged in, a 'Save this Book!' button appears below a book and once clicked the book will save to the user's profile.  To see all saved books, click on 'See Your Books' in the navigation bar. To search for more books, click on 'Search For Books'. The user also has the ability to delete books from their profile by clicking the button 'Delete This Book!' at the bottom of the book card in their profile. Once the user is done searching books, they can logout by clicking 'Logout' in the navigation bar.

## Credits
Starter code was supplied for the **book-search-engine** application. The Unit 21 MERN Activities (especially 26 & 28 Mini Project) were utilized in refactoring the code from a RESTful API into a GRAPHQL API built with Apollo Server. The activites helped with authenticating logins, full stack code and syntax for the **book-search-engine** application.
